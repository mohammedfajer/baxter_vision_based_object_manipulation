## 1. Introduction  <a name="introduction"></a>
This repository document and host the "Perception and Control of a Bi-manual Industrial Robot for Vision-Based Object Manipulation" project, an undergraduate final year project at the School of Computing, University of Leeds. 

This project is not under active development, but feel free to look around.

This project was developmed with Ubuntua 14.04.6 LTS, ROS Indigo and Python 3.x. The robot model used in the development is [Baxter](https://www.rethinkrobotics.com/) from Rethink Robotics.

## 2. About The Project <a name="paragraph1"></a>
This initial project aim was to implement human-robot handover, later changed due to unforeseen circumstances to vision-based object manipulation as a substitute for human-robot handoff. Nevertheless, one of the initial objectives was to create a teleoperation system where a human operator remotely controls the robot motion by enabling the robot to mimic the human arm motion. Thus this project contains two main parts; one is the teleoperation of Baxter and the other vision-based object manipulation where both explore algorithms in robotic perception and control.
