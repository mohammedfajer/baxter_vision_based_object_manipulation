custom yolov3 object detection package
    this package bridges using cv_bridge rgb image data from our simulated rgb-d kinect or xtion sensors
    use trained custom yolov3 deep neural network model on input image and make 2d object detection
    publishes the object class and its 2d info

point cloud 3d object recognition package
    locate object 6d pose 
    since we have the object 3d model from depth sensor point cloud
    and 2d pose in RGB image 
    we can locate the object's 6d pose by fitting the 3d model onto the RGB-D image


creates the final seem with objects, camera, scene and final environment for pick and place
